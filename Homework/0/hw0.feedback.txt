Kyle,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)

However,

- The screenshots are too small to read clearly.

- A little header or cover page with your name, class, assignment, date, etc.
  is always good to have in any assignment of this type.



Peace,
